When \\nI learned that Linda had won, I was deeply troubled and \\nunhappy. My body was shaking with uneasiness. My heart \\nbeat quickly and my face became reddish. I had to run out of \\nthe concert hall to settle down. Sitting on the stairs alone, I \\nrecalled what my teacher had said. “Life is about winning, not \\nnecessarily about winning against others but winning at being \\nyou. And the way to win is to figure out who you are and do \\nyour best.” He was absolutely right. I had no reason to oppose \\nmy friend. Instead, I should focus on myself and my own \\nimprovement.

We can \\nbecome experts in some areas, like speaking a language or \\nknowing our favorite foods, simply by living our lives, but in \\nmany other domains expertise requires considerable training \\nand effort. What’s more, expertise is domain specific. The \\nexpertise that we work hard to acquire in one domain will \\ncarry over only imperfectly to related ones, and not at all to \\nunrelated ones. In the end, as much as we may want to become \\nexperts on everything in our lives, there simply isn’t enough \\ntime to do so. Even in areas where we could, it won’t \\nnecessarily be worth the effort. It’s clear that we should \\nconcentrate our own expertise on those domains of choice that \\nare most common and/or important to our lives, and those we \\nactively enjoy learning about and choosing from. \\n① 문성 함양에는 타고난 재능보다 노력과 훈련이 요하다.\\n\\n② 자신에게 의미 있는 역을 정해서 문성을 키워야 한다.\\n\\n③ 문성을 기르기 해서는 구체 인 계획과 실천이 필수 이다.\\n\\n④ 문가는 일의 우선순 를 결정해서 업무를 수행해야 한다.\\n⑤ 문가가 되기 해서는 다양한 분야에 심을 가져야 한다.\\n\\n  이제 듣기 문제가 끝났습니다. 18번부터는 문제지의 지시에 \\n\\n따라 답을 하시기 바랍니다.\\n\\n이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.\\n\\n\\n\\n짝수형 3\\n\\n3\\n8\\n\\n21.  친 the role of the ‘lion’s historians’가 다음 에서 의미\\n하는 바로 가장 한 것은?\\n\\nThere is an African proverb that says, ‘Till the lions have \\ntheir historians, tales of hunting will always glorify the hunter’. \\nThe proverb is about power, control and law making. \\nEnvironmental journalists have to play the role of the ‘lion’s \\nhistorians’. They have to put across the point of view of the \\nenvironment to people who make the laws. They have to be the \\nvoice of wild India. The present rate of human consumption is \\ncompletely unsustainable. Forest, wetlands, wastelands, coastal \\nzones, eco-sensitive zones, they are all seen as disposable for \\nthe accelerating demands of human population. But to ask for \\nany change in human behaviour―whether it be to cut down on \\nconsumption, alter lifestyles or decrease population growth―\\nis seen as a violation of human rights. But at some point human \\nrights become ‘wrongs’. It’s time we changed our thinking so \\nthat there is no difference between the rights of humans and the \\nrights of the rest of the environment.\\n\\n① uncovering the history of a species’ biological evolution\\n② urging a shift to sustainable human behaviour for nature\\n③ fighting against widespread violations of human rights\\n④ rewriting history for more underrepresented people\\n⑤ restricting the power of environmental lawmakers\\n\\n22. 다음 의 요지로 가장 한 것은?\\n\\nPrior to file-sharing services, music albums landed exclusively \\nin the hands of music critics before their release. These critics \\nwould listen to them well before the general public could and \\npreview them for the rest of the world in their reviews. Once \\nthe internet made music easily accessible and allowed even \\nadvanced releases to spread through online social networks, \\navailability of new music became democratized, which meant \\ncritics no longer had unique access. That is, critics and \\nlaypeople alike could obtain new music simultaneously. Social \\nmedia services also enabled people to publicize their views on \\nnew songs, list their new favorite bands in their social media \\nbios, and argue over new music endlessly on message boards. \\nThe result was that critics now could access the opinions of the \\nmasses on a particular album before writing their reviews. \\nThus, instead of music reviews guiding popular opinion toward \\nart (as they did in preinternet times), music reviews began to \\nreflect― consciously or subconsciously― public opinion. \\n\\n* laypeople: 비 문가\\n\\n① 미디어 환경의 변화로 음악 비평이 의 향을 받게 되었다.\\n\\n② 인터넷의 발달로 다양한 장르의 음악을 하는 것이 가능해졌다.\\n\\n③ 비평가의 음악 비평은 자신의 주 인 경험을 기반으로 한다. \\n\\n④ 오늘날 새로운 음악은 의 기호를 확인한 후에 공개된다.\\n\\n⑤ 온라인 환경의 두로 음악 비평의 질이 반 으로 상승하 다.\\n\\n23. 다음 의 주제로 가장 한 것은? [3 ]\\n\\nDifficulties arise when we do not think of people and \\nmachines as collaborative systems, but assign whatever tasks \\ncan be automated to the machines and leave the rest to people. \\nThis ends up requiring people to behave in machine-like \\nfashion, in ways that differ from human capabilities. We \\nexpect people to monitor machines, which means keeping alert \\nfor long periods, something we are bad at. We require people \\nto do repeated operations with the extreme precision and \\naccuracy required by machines, again something we are not \\ngood at. When we divide up the machine and human \\ncomponents of a task in this way, we fail to take advantage of \\nhuman strengths and capabilities but instead rely upon areas \\nwhere we are genetically, biologically unsuited. Yet, when \\npeople fail, they are blamed. \\n\\n① difficulties of overcoming human weaknesses to avoid failure\\n② issues of allocating unfit tasks to humans in automated systems\\n③ benefits of allowing machines and humans to work together\\n④ reasons why humans continue to pursue machine automation\\n⑤ influences of human actions on a machine’s performance\\n\\n24. 다음 의 제목으로 가장 한 것은?\\n\\nPeople don’t usually think of touch as a temporal \\nphenomenon, but it is every bit as time-based as it is spatial. \\nYou can carry out an experiment to see for yourself. Ask a \\nfriend to cup his hand, palm face up, and close his eyes. Place \\na small ordinary object in his palm― a ring, an eraser, \\nanything will do― and ask him to identify it without moving \\nany part of his hand. He won’t have a clue other than weight \\nand maybe overall size. Then tell him to keep his eyes closed \\nand move his fingers over the object. He’ll most likely identify \\nit at once. By allowing the fingers to move, you’ve added time \\nto the sensory perception of touch. There’s a direct analogy \\nbetween the fovea at the center of your retina and your \\nfingertips, both of which have high acuity. Your ability to \\nmake complex use of touch, such as buttoning your shirt or \\nunlocking your front door in the dark, depends on continuous \\ntime-varying patterns of touch sensation.\\n\\n* analogy: 유사 ** fovea: (망막의) 심와(窩) *** retina: 망막\\n\\n① Touch and Movement: Two Major Elements of Humanity\\n② The Role of Touch in Forming the Concept of Time\\n③ Time Does Matter: A Hidden Essence of Touch\\n④ How to Use the Five Senses in a Timely Manner\\n⑤ The Surprising Function of Touch as a Booster of Knowledge\\n\\n이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.\\n\\n\\n\\n4 짝수형\\n\\n4\\n8\\n\\n25. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?\\n\\nThe graph above shows the online shares of retail sales for \\neach of six countries in 2012 and in 2019.

[3 ]\\n\\nRegulations covering scientific experiments on human subjects \\nare strict. Subjects must give their informed, written consent, \\nand experimenters must submit their proposed experiments to \\nthorough examination by overseeing bodies. Scientists who \\nexperiment on themselves can, functionally if not legally, avoid \\nthe restrictions ① associated with experimenting on other people. \\nThey can also sidestep most of the ethical issues involved: \\nnobody, presumably, is more aware of an experiment’s potential \\nhazards than the scientist who devised ② it. Nonetheless, \\nexperimenting on oneself remains ③ deeply problematic. One \\nobvious drawback is the danger involved; knowing that it \\nexists ④ does nothing to reduce it. A less obvious drawback is \\nthe limited range of data that the experiment can generate. \\nHuman anatomy and physiology vary, in small but significant \\nways, according to gender, age, lifestyle, and other factors. \\nExperimental results derived from a single subject are, therefore, \\nof limited value; there is no way to know ⑤ what the subject’s \\nresponses are typical or atypical of the response of humans as a \\ngroup.\\n\\n* consent: 동의 ** anatomy: (해부학 ) 구조\\n\\n*** physiology: 생리  상\\n\\n30. 다음 의  친 부분 , 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 하지 \\n\\n않은 것은?\\n\\nHow the bandwagon effect occurs is demonstrated by the \\nhistory of measurements of the speed of light. Because this \\nspeed is the basis of the theory of relativity, it’s one of the \\nmost frequently and carefully measured ① quantities in science. \\nAs far as we know, the speed hasn’t changed over time. \\nHowever, from 1870 to 1900, all the experiments found speeds \\nthat were too high. Then, from 1900 to 1950, the ② opposite \\nhappened― all the experiments found speeds that were too \\nlow! This kind of error, where results are always on one side of \\nthe real value, is called “bias.” It probably happened because \\nover time, experimenters subconsciously adjusted their results \\nto ③ match what they expected to find. If a result fit what \\nthey expected, they kept it. If a result didn’t fit, they threw it out. \\nThey weren’t being intentionally dishonest, just ④ influenced \\nby the conventional wisdom.

In the classic model of the Sumerian economy, the temple \\nfunctioned as an administrative authority governing commodity \\nproduction, collection, and redistribution. The discovery of \\nadministrative tablets from the temple complexes at Uruk \\nsuggests that token use and consequently writing evolved as a \\ntool of centralized economic governance. Given the lack of \\narchaeological evidence from Uruk-period domestic sites, it is \\nnot clear whether individuals also used the system for \\n\\n. For that matter, it is not clear \\nhow widespread literacy was at its beginnings. The use of \\nidentifiable symbols and pictograms on the early tablets is \\nconsistent with administrators needing a lexicon that was \\nmutually intelligible by literate and nonliterate parties.

Choosing similar friends can have a rationale. Assessing \\nthe survivability of an environment can be risky (if an \\nenvironment turns out to be deadly, for instance, it might be \\ntoo late by the time you found out), so humans have evolved \\nthe desire to associate with similar individuals as a way to \\nperform this function efficiently.

Thanks to newly developed neuroimaging technology, we \\nnow have access to the specific brain changes that occur during \\nlearning. Even though all of our brains contain the same basic \\nstructures, our neural networks are as unique as our fingerprints. \\nThe latest developmental neuroscience research has shown \\nthat the brain is much more malleable throughout life than \\npreviously assumed; it develops in response to its own \\nprocesses, to its immediate and distant “environments,” and \\nto its past and current situations. The brain seeks to create \\nmeaning through establishing or refining existing neural \\nnetworks. When we learn a new fact or skill, our neurons \\ncommunicate to form networks of connected information. Using \\nthis knowledge or skill results in structural changes to allow \\nsimilar future impulses to travel more quickly and efficiently \\nthan others. High-activity synaptic connections are stabilized \\nand strengthened, while connections with relatively low use are \\nweakened and eventually pruned. In this way, our brains are \\n\\n.

If many peoples do not view political power as a \\ncoercive force, nor as the most valued domain, then the leap \\nfrom ‘the political’ to ‘domination’ (as coercion), and from \\nthere to ‘domination of women’, is a shaky one.

Herbert \\nSimon’s “parable of the ant” makes this point very clearly. \\nImagine an ant walking along a beach, and (b) visualize \\ntracking the trajectory of the ant as it moves. The trajectory \\nwould show a lot of twists and turns, and would be very \\nirregular and complicated. One could then suppose that the ant \\nhad equally complicated (c) internal navigational abilities, \\nand work out what these were likely to be by analyzing the \\ntrajectory to infer the rules and mechanisms that could produce \\nsuch a complex navigational path. The complexity of the \\ntrajectory, however, “is really a complexity in the surface of \\nthe beach, not a complexity in the ant.” In reality, the ant may \\nbe using a set of very (d) complex rules: it is the interaction \\nof these rules with the environment that actually produces the \\ncomplex trajectory, not the ant alone. Put more generally, the \\nparable of the ant illustrates that there is no necessary \\ncorrelation between the complexity of an (e) observed behavior \\nand the complexity of the mechanism that produces it.\\n\\n* parable: 우화 ** trajectory: 이동 경로\\n\\n41. 윗 의 제목으로 가장 한 것은?\\n\\n① Open the Mysterious Door to Environmental Complexity!\\n② Peaceful Coexistence of Human Beings and Animals\\n③ What Makes the Complexity of Animal Behavior?\\n④ Animals’ Dilemma: Finding Their Way in a Human World\\n⑤ Environmental Influences on Human Behavior Complexity\\n\\n42.  친 (a)～(e) 에서 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 하지 않은 \\n것은?
